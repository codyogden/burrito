Let's face it! Trello is an amazing tool, but it can quickly become a nightmare when you're using it with your growing growing team. Trello's ["my cards" view](https://trello.com/me/cards) is about as useful as a box of broken hammers. That's why I built Burrito.

Burrito takes the cards to which you've been assigned and puts them in a simple, "to do" style list. You can search, filter by date, last activity, or alphabetically, and click to a specific Trello card without distracting boards or notifications.

## We're Open Source
We respect that Trello holds sensitive data for your company. To ensure your privacy is respected, we've made our entire tool open source. We do not run any type of analytics or user behavior tracking in our project. You or your organization are free to run your own copy. See [Running Locally](#running-locally) for more information.
